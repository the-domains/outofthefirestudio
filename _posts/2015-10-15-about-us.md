# About Us

Out of the Fire Studio was established as a pottery studio in Edson Alberta in 1999 by Cindy Clarke. Joined soon after by Jim Willett, the pottery relocated to Edmonton Alberta in 2001 where it became a source for pottery for over 45 retailers across western Canada.Thousands of people from around the world have purchased and enjoyed handcrafted stoneware pottery from Cindy Clarke through Out of the Fire Studio. In January of 2007, we made the decision to close down our wholesale pottery studio and open a studio and retail gallery where we could sell our products and promote the work of many of our friends. After a year and a half we closed our downtown studio and gallery and downsized again. We continued to be involved with pottery making at a home studio level. We provide pottery by commission and by happenstance (we have various pieces of pottery in stock from time to time but do not carry a full stock of items),and have begun a new direction with "The Clay Teacher". In May of 2014 the studio has opened in a new location in the Village of Coutts Alberta. Located in the art room of the historic Coutts Village School we are continuing to produce pottery, provide drop in clay lessons, and produce more video for our Youtube channel. Pottery from the studio is available by contacting us by email or by our toll free (In North America) phone number 1-eight-five-five-218-9974.. Thank you for visiting our website. Jim and Cindy
