# Welcome to our pottery studio.

Pottery made by Cindy Clarke and Jim Willett in their Canadian studio has delighted clients around the world for many years.We are now located in the[Village of Coutts Alberta][0]and are continuing to work with clay in our studio located in the historic Coutts Village School. Based on the belief by Cindy, a potter for over thirty-five years, that good stoneware pottery should be used, not just set up on a shelf to be another dust collecting ornament, every piece is finished so edges are chip resistant, pot bottoms are trimmed with a "foot" for appearance and sanded smooth to protect your table, and the handcrafted pottery is thrown heavily enough to stand up to years of day to day usage. All the pottery has been designed to be a quality product which will stand the test of time. All of our handcrafted stoneware pottery is microwave, oven, and dishwasher safe. Here on our web site you will find examples of stoneware items which have been produced by Cindy and Jim over the years. Custom pottery is available by commission. Many pieces are in stock on a first come first served basis.
