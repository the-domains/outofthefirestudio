Stoneware pottery tea pots have been in use for hundreds of years and are valued for their ability to hold heat while brewing a perfect cup of tea. We are proud of our  basket handle stoneware pottery teapot with a unique handle design which is the most ergonomically correct we have seen. With perfect balance, one hand holds the basket style handle and the other lifts the special pouring handle for a no strain pour. Perfect for someone with poor flexibility or stiff joints. It has to be tried to be believed, and once you've tried it you'll wonder why no one else has thought of it. Features Cindy's no drip spout, stay put lid, and internal spout strainer. Available in any of our glaze combinations. Get one for yourself and one for a gift. Capacity is about one and a half litres. Our matching tea cups and cream and sugar sets are designed to be comfortable to use as well, to make your tea time pleasurable.
