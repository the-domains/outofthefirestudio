Everyone has a favourite mug and once you've found it you'll never want to let it go, with or without handles! Our Mike mug is a traditional round wheel thrown stoneware pottery mug with a glaze treatment that combines glazed and unglazed surfaces so each mug has its own individual feel. The round shape of the bottom portion of the mug helps to keep drinks hot longer. Approximately four inches tall and three and a half inches in diameter.Shown in Mountain Mist and Mountain Mist with Rose.Also available in our other glaze colours.
